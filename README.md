Nice simple ping bot
made to ping matthew

Has the ability to ping anyone. Creates threads after too many pings to prevent clutter.
Auto deletes threads after 2 hours and has the ability to clear messages and threads.
Will continously recieve updates.

Has a setimage feature.

Unfortunately, the most important command of this program cannot be listed as a slash command due to Discord's API limit
on discord.interactions. That's why its not in the cogs folder.
