# **Simple Ping Bot**

- Has the ability to ping anyone. Creates threads after too many pings to prevent clutter.
- Clear messages and threads made by the bot
- Auto deletes threads after 2 hours and has the ability to clear messages and threads.
- Has automatic and manual sync for slash commands
- Has a setimage feature

Unfortunately, the most important command of this program cannot be listed as a slash command due to Discord's API limit
on discord.interactions. That's why its not in the cogs folder.
